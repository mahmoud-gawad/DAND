# Data Analysis Nanodegree

This is a repository where I will host the projects for the Data Analysis Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Explore Weather Trends

The first project is to explore the weather trends globally and locally and make observations based on charts made from both data. You can find the project [here](Explore%20Weather%20Trends).
