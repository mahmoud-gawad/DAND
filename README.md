# Data Analysis Nanodegree

This is a repository where I will host the projects for the Data Analysis Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Explore Weather Trends

The first project is to explore the weather trends globally and locally and make observations based on charts made from both data. You can find the project [here](Explore%20Weather%20Trends).

## Case Study: Wikipedia Web Crawl

In this project, I was tasked with making a web crawler that would open a random Wikipedia article, select the first article link inside it, and follow that pattern until it reaches the article "Philosophy" or fail to do so. The details of the project and its implementation can be found [here](Wikipedia%20Web%20Crawl).

## Explore US Bikeshare Data

In this project, it was required to look at bikeshare data of 3 different US cities, perform data cleaning, data wrangling, and apply principles of statistics and data visualization to extract useful info and insights from the data. The full details can be found [here](Explore%20US%20Bikeshare%20Data).
